*****************BUDGET CONTROLLER PROJECT*************************

This is a budgeting app. This application calculates monthly income vs expenditure 

It accepts values in the form of Income and Expenditures and calculates the overall funds available for the month for Budgeting/Planning purposes.
The app has 3 fields for the user to input values. First box is a dropdown Indicating +/- (meaning Income/Expenditure). Second box is a Description box which is a text field to describe the Income/Expense. The third box is a field which accepts any number (negative or positive number)

The user of this app has to fill up these 3 fields and the app calculates the overall budget for the month. It also displays results of expenses in the form of percentage.
